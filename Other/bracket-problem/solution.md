This problem involves checking if a string with multiple types of brackets (`'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, `']'`) is valid based on their correct pairing and order.

### Problem: **Valid Brackets**

You are given a string containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'`. Your task is to determine if the input string is valid. The string is valid if:

1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

### Example:

1. Input: `"()[]{}"` → Output: `True`
2. Input: `"(]"` → Output: `False`
3. Input: `"([)]"` → Output: `False`
4. Input: `{[()]}` → Output: `True`

### Approach:

A stack is a good way to solve this problem. When you encounter an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), push it onto the stack. When you encounter a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), check if it matches the top of the stack (the most recent opening bracket). If it matches, pop the top of the stack. If it doesn't match, the string is invalid.

#### Solution in Python:

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    # Dictionary to store mapping of open and close brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    stack = []

    # Iterate through the string characters
    for char in s:
        # If it's a closing bracket, check for matching open bracket in stack
        if char in bracket_map:
            # Get the top of the stack if it exists, otherwise use a dummy value
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'

            # Check if the top of the stack matches the current closing bracket
            if bracket_map[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(char)

    # The string is valid if no unpaired brackets are left in the stack
    return not stack

# Example usage
print(isValid("()[]{}"))   # Output: True
print(isValid("(]"))       # Output: False
print(isValid("([)]"))     # Output: False
print(isValid("{[()]}"))   # Output: True
```

### Explanation:

- **Stack Usage**: Opening brackets are pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the top element of the stack is checked for a match. If there is no match, the string is invalid.
- **Edge Case**: If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, or if any unclosed brackets remain at the end, the string is invalid.

Here’s the solution to the **Valid Brackets** problem implemented in JavaScript:

### Solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
  // Map to store the pairs of open and close brackets
  const bracketMap = {
    ")": "(",
    "}": "{",
    "]": "[",
  };

  // Stack to hold opening brackets
  const stack = [];

  // Iterate over each character in the string
  for (let char of s) {
    // If it's a closing bracket
    if (char in bracketMap) {
      // Pop the top of the stack, or assign a dummy value if stack is empty
      const topElement = stack.length ? stack.pop() : "#";

      // If the popped element doesn't match the current closing bracket
      if (bracketMap[char] !== topElement) {
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      // If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
      stack.push(char);
    }
  }

  // If the stack is empty, all brackets were valid and matched
  return stack.length === 0;
}

// Example usage
console.log(isValid("()[]{}")); // Output: true
console.log(isValid("(]")); // Output: false
console.log(isValid("([)]")); // Output: false
console.log(isValid("{[()]}")); // Output: true
```

### Explanation:

- **Bracket Map**: The `bracketMap` object holds the corresponding opening brackets for each closing bracket.
- **Stack**: As we loop through the string, we push opening brackets onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the most recent opening bracket (i.e., the top of the stack).
- If everything matches and the stack is empty by the end, the string is valid. Otherwise, it's invalid.

### Example Test Cases:

```javascript
console.log(isValid("()[]{}")); // true
console.log(isValid("(]")); // false
console.log(isValid("([)]")); // false
console.log(isValid("{[()]}")); // true
```

This solution runs efficiently in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string, since each character is processed only once, and stack operations are O(1). Let me know if you need any more details or adjustments!
